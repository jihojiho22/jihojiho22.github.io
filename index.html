                <p>To any chicken enthusiast, no words can possibly describe the sensation of biting into a crispy layer
                    of
                    fried goodness following a juicy chunk of meat that burst in flavors. Just the thought of it summons
                    your
                    saliva right beneath your tongue. Moments like these are what The COOP offers with our highly
                    recognized
                    chicken series. Along with the best of traditional Korean flavors and refined art of cooking, The
                    COOP has

                    most
                    organic source of ingredients. Our chicken is from a local farm nearby, they are raised in a free
                    range
                    environment for the least amount of stress, restricted from hormones that promote abnormal growth,
                    and is
